Just a green screen I use to make PNGs with no background. It's big, so I released it for free as I haven't seen anything this big for free.

If you use it / add it to your resources, please give credit.

Here's the link to the post with scripts for making clothing, and for vehicles check comments for vehicles script !

best time is during the day as I can’t be bothered to remove the light from the airplane hangar
